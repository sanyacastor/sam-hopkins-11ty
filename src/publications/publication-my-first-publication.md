description: My idea for this project was to explore the state of being
  stationary within a city that is in constant flux. From 06.09.06 until
  11.09.06 for 6 hours a day I sat on a bench in Kuznicza Street in Wroclaw. I
  wanted to see whether, for that small section of the city, there were
  patterns/routines that I could identify, and try to learn them, as one would
  learn a song.  However I soon realized that by merely being in the space for
  extended periods of time I began to attract people’s curiosity. Although I had
  set out to watch and learn the space I began to feel that it was in fact me
  that was being observed. As the days passed I felt this mutual curiosity
  mount. But was it actually mutual?  To explore this further, when I had
  finished the action, I asked Zosia Jarosz and Marius Jodko to interview people
  in that particular space about ‘the guy on the bench’. The video presents this
  material; a spectrum of memories, encompassing the wildly inaccurate, the
  highly perceptive and those that simply do not look.
