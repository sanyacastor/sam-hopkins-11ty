title: 'Grassroots Upgraded'
year: 2011
isbn: 978-90-5856-391-0
description:
  Grassroots upgraded is less a development project than an ironic take on the
  world of development. The approach is conceptual and political, the choice of
  medium aesthetic. Slum TV goes beyond the stereotypes that have shaped our
  representations of Africa.
