customTitle: Alex Nikolic Interviews African Maximalism
dates: "2009"
collaborators: African Maximalism
cardDescription: An art exhibition and research project about public space in Nairobi
previewDescription: >-
  If you understand Art as the imaginative representation of the world, then it
  is not only an integral part of everyday life, but can also be seen as a
  barometer of intellectual freedom. Art in the public sphere, the performing of
  cultural expressions in public, is a further distillation of this and a
  critical indicator of a culturally healthy society.


  Nairobi pulsates with a wealth of new forms of cultural expression, many of which exist beyond the frontiers of conventional institutions. The idea behind ‘It’s a pity that we only exist in the future’ was to explore the city’s terrain with the aim of representing these phenomena within the context of discourse about public space.


  This was not an exhaustive show, but rather a sample of the city’s cultural nuggets, tracing a seam of art forms existing within different social, cultural and geographical groups. Showcasing work by the Maasai Mbili art collective, Solo 7, Hapa TV, Biki Kangwana and Jacob Wachira, the Nyayo Monument Photographers, Slum TV, Lukas Pusch, Ukoo Flani and Cultural Video Foundation


  Maybe we do not only exist in the future, but we also exist in the present, it’s just a question of knowing how to see ourselves. And that is one of the things that African Maximalism is trying to do. We try to make things visible, we try to connect loose synapses within the city, the country, the continent, and re-establish broken circuits. We create situations, we dream of being catalysts.


  African Maximalism is as an open source movement, inclusive to all that want to learn the language. It’s about the freedom of producing innovative work, without the burden of being an individual. We are a movement with no leader, an idea with no manifesto, an aesthetic with no rules. Come and join us.

a.n.: Thanks that you invited me for the show, it's possible that i have quite a developed idea, about art and public space in general, but how and why did you choose such a topic, and what is there relevant for you, in terms of Nairobi?

AM: In the sphere of local contemporary art practice it seems that artists are not engaging with public space, hence the title is a provocation. But if you further interrogate local cultural production, and understand art in public space as the performance of cultural expression in public, than Nairobi is a goldmine. 

a.n: What's provocative about the title? By the way, do you know the story about the gold of the socialists international? If it would have been found by the capitalists, it would have turned, in their hands, into coal.

AM: Of course the title suggests that art practice in public space does not exist, or is an almost utopian fantasy, but actually this is not the case. It is merely that the local institutions, which incidentally are almost exclusively controlled by foreign interests, do not showcase or represent this form of local art production.  

a.n: Maybe, we get later back to the foreign interests, but what is your goal?

AM: Our goal is twofold, to disrupt the current practice of the local art institutions, and shift their focus to recognise a local cultural practice, which is simply not featured. However, neither do we seek simply to celebrate an 'exotic' art practice. By including these artists within this space, we also intend to challenge them, and to stimulate within them further questioning of their own practice. 

a.n: And the danger that the gold could turn into coal?

AM: Then we crush it into diamonds. 

a.n: Ok, can I be a bit polemic about that, and ask you, would you redistribute that diamonds, to the mothers of the people who went missing in that public space in the last two years? 

AM: We are very aware of working in an environment, where thousands of young men simply disappear. We don't think our show can solve that problem. But what our show can do, is to   analyse what is permitted in public space, and stimulate an interdisciplinary discourse between artists, activists and theoreticians. So, in answer to your question, the wealth we  distribute is the wealth of understanding. 

a.n: But you know, I never met more than 30 people at openings here, and even although I'm not living here, I already have the impression that I know most of them.. but maybe I'm wrong.

AM: Well, that is exactly point. The Art field is limited, which is why we hope that this show can create a space for interdisciplinary discourse and cross-pollinate between different fields of knowledge. Regarding the field of Art, the time has long passed when galleries and exhibitions are about looking at well crafted objects. We understand our role as catalysts of ideas, connectors of different thoughts, creators of situations in which viewers themselves create and imagine alternative possibilities to the present. 

a.n: I mean, this is not new, and to me sounds like you are simply exporting European avant-garde thought from the 1960's and planting it in a new field. In fact, is this not simply the latest version of a long history of cultural imperialism? Where is the African in your Maximalism?

AM: (Laughter)... Whilst an accusation of Cultural Imperialism is to some extent valid, ultimately it is short-sighted. It is true that we use tools and strategies gleaned from Contemporary Art discourse, and this discourse does originate in the Global North. But, this is just what they are; tools, which can be abandoned if they don't work. The last decade of global culture has not proved the theories of Cultural Homogenisation to be correct. People are cultural agents and chose and select from the mainstream of culture. Hiphop may have originated stateside but to see Kenyan hiphop as simply derivative of that culture is to misconceive contemporary culture. 

a.n: Well, I'm not sure if I buy this... but I will hold further judgement until I see what you have to offer in the show. Afro Max, it's been a pleasure. 

AM: Karibu. See you on the 13th.
