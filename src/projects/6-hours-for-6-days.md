My idea for this project was to explore the state of being stationary within a
city that is in constant flux. From 06.09.06 until 11.09.06 for 6 hours a day I
sat on a bench in Kuznicza Street in Wroclaw. I wanted to see whether, for that
small section of the city, there were patterns/routines that I could identify,
and try to learn them, as one would learn a song.

However I soon realized that by merely being in the space for extended periods
of time I began to attract people’s curiosity. Although I had set out to watch
and learn the space I began to feel that it was in fact me that was being
observed. As the days passed I felt this mutual curiosity mount. But was it
actually mutual?

To explore this further, when I had finished the action, I asked Zosia Jarosz
and Marius Jodko to interview people in that particular space about ‘the guy on
the bench’. The video presents this material; a spectrum of memories,
encompassing the wildly inaccurate, the highly perceptive and those that simply
do not look.
