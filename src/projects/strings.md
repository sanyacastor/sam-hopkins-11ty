cardDescription: Sisal string structures built in the forest which try to evoke
  shafts of light coming through the trees
previewDescription: >-
  The initial idea for this came from an old photo I saw of Grand Central
  Station in New York. The photo is black and white and shows the huge atrium in
  the interior of the station. Shafts of light stream through large windows on
  the side of the building illuminating the dwarfed figures standing there. The
  light seems so tactile, almost as if it actually was a three dimensional form.


  Walking in the forest I had a similar experience of shafts of light pouring through gaps in the foliage in the afternoon sun. I tried to recreate this phenomenon, to give the illusion of light, but using sisal string.


  These structures were build having developed a few prototypes first. They are made from one piece of string, which goes from the base to the top, and back again. They are temporary and at some stage will decay and fade away.
