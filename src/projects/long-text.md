My idea for this project was to explore the state of being stationary within a
city that is in constant flux. From 06.09.06 until 11.09.06 for 6 hours a day I
sat on a bench in Kuznicza Street in Wroclaw. I wanted to see whether, for that
small section of the city, there were patterns/routines that I could identify,
and try to learn them, as one would learn a song.
However I soon realized that by merely being in the space for extended periods
of time I began to attract people’s curiosity. Although I had set out to watch
and learn the space I began to feel that it was in fact me that was being
observed. As the days passed I felt this mutual curiosity mount. But was it
actually mutual?
To explore this further, when I had finished the action, I asked Zosia Jarosz
and Marius Jodko to interview people in that particular space about ‘the guy on
the bench’. The video presents this material; a spectrum of memories,
encompassing the wildly inaccurate, the highly perceptive and those that simply
do not look.

However, as I delved deeper into this exploration, I realized that my mere presence on the bench began to alter the dynamics of the space itself. Passersby, initially indifferent to my presence, gradually became intrigued by the sight of someone sitting for prolonged periods in what seemed like an inconsequential spot. Their glances turned into stares, and before long, I felt like a spectacle, a feature of the street that they couldn't quite decipher.
As days turned into weeks, the line between observer and observed blurred. While my initial intention was to study the routines and patterns of the street, I found myself becoming the subject of scrutiny. It was as if my stationary presence invited speculation and conjecture from those who passed by. The curiosity I had hoped to satisfy about the city's rhythms now turned inward, as I questioned the nature of this mutual observation. Was it truly mutual, or was I merely projecting my own fascination onto the situation?
To delve deeper into this phenomenon, I enlisted the help of Zosia Jarosz and Marius Jodko to conduct interviews with individuals frequenting Kuznicza Street during my hours on the bench. Their task was to gather perspectives on "the guy on the bench," shedding light on how my presence was perceived and interpreted by the diverse array of people inhabiting that space.
The resulting video material captured a spectrum of responses, ranging from wildly inaccurate assumptions to remarkably perceptive insights, and even some individuals who seemed oblivious to my presence altogether. It became apparent that my experiment had not only revealed the fluidity of urban life but also highlighted the intricate dance between visibility and invisibility in public spaces.
As I reflect on this experience, I realize that my initial quest to understand the city's rhythms evolved into an exploration of human connection and perception. Through the lens of a simple bench on Kuznicza Street, I witnessed the power of presence to shape our understanding of space and the profound impact of shared experiences, even in the midst of constant flux.# Exploring the Dynamics of Stationarity in a City of Flux

## Introduction

My project aimed to explore the state of being stationary within a city that is in constant flux. From 06.09.06 until 11.09.06, for six hours a day, I sat on a bench in Kuznicza Street in Wroclaw. My goal was to observe and identify patterns or routines within this small section of the city.

## Initial Observations

However, I quickly realized that my presence on the bench began to attract the curiosity of passersby. Instead of being the observer, I felt like I was the one being observed. This mutual curiosity began to mount, prompting me to question its nature and whether it was truly reciprocal.

## The Shift in Dynamics

As days passed, I found myself becoming the subject of speculation and conjecture. The line between observer and observed blurred, and my experiment evolved into an exploration of human perception and connection in urban spaces.

## Enlisting Assistance

To delve deeper into this phenomenon, I enlisted the help of Zosia Jarosz and Marius Jodko. Their task was to interview people in the space about "the guy on the bench," capturing a spectrum of perspectives on my presence.

## Results and Analysis

The resulting video material revealed a range of responses, from wildly inaccurate assumptions to remarkably perceptive insights. It became evident that my experiment had illuminated the fluidity of urban life and the intricate dance between visibility and invisibility in public spaces.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my project transcended its initial aim of understanding city rhythms to become an exploration of human connection and perception. Through the lens of a simple bench on Kuznicza Street, I witnessed the power of presence to shape our understanding of space and the profound impact of shared experiences amidst constant change.
