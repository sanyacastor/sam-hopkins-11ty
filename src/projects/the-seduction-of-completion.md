previewDescription: >-
  This performance entailed me numbering the bricks of an exterior prison wall
  in Leuven for seven hours a day, over a period of 10 days. The bricks were
  numbered in chalk. I counted 15,776 bricks.  


  The theoretical basis for the piece was the ambivalent nature of categorisation, which can be both useful, absurd, or in some cases, utterly abhorrent. However, whilst the action of numbering in bricks in chalk could be seen as ridiculous, within the context of an exhibition dealing with Buchenwald and the atrocities of the Nazi regime it assumed a more sombre and reflective quality.   


  The performance attempted, in both an absurd and perhaps ultimately futile manner, some form of representing the victims of WWII and the Holocaust. By performing the action day after day, and leaving a slowly developing, yet highly ephemeral trace on the wall, I hoped to give some indication, through both time and space, of the unimaginable scale of the atrocities. 


  Thanks to: Central Prison of Leuven
