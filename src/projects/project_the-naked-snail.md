title: The naked snail
dates: "2006"
cardDescription: A slug moustache moves across my face.
previewDescription: "Having studied History before studying Visual Art I find
  the issue of a ‘legitimate’ history a compelling one. Spending 2006 studying
  in Weimar I was struck by the way in which one history was presented as more
  ‘right’ than another. Whilst Goethe and Schiller are seen as historical
  figures which are truly representative of German culture, the Third Reich is
  seen as some kind of aberration, a period which has no organic connection to
  the corpus of German history.   This led me to the idea of prosthesis as a
  metaphor. In many ways it seems that the Nazi period is treated as an
  extension on top of the German ‘body’, that there is no organic connection
  between this and the rest of German history. Exploring possible forms to
  express this uneasy relationship between different pasts I became interested
  in the power of the Hitler moustache as symbol for this period.   In an
  attempt to explore these concepts of organic connection and legitimacy I
  developed a video piece involving a slug that is initially positioned as a
  moustache. During the course of the video the slug moves from its position,
  explores the contours of my face and finally escapes to my hair. Although at
  first the moustache reference may be clear, through the passage of time and
  the transit of the slug, the references become more ambiguous. "
